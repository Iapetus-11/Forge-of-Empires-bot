# Forge-of-Empires-bot
A bot made in Python 3.7 with pyautogui that collects gold, supplies and does some other stuff in Forge of Empires. The bot uses image recognition to automatically detect resources and collect them unlike some other bots that depend on a schedule, this bot can adapt to different base designs and newer buildings automatically.

## TODO:

* ~~Figure out how to do markup on the README.txt file.~~
* Collect soldiers/millitary stuff from army buildings ingame.
* make scanning/image detection faster and less heavy on resources.
* add detection and correction for ingame glitches and announcments.
