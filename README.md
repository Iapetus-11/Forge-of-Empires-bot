# Forge-of-Empires-bot
A bot made in python with pyautogui that collects gold, supplies and does some other stuff in Forge of Empires. The bot uses image recognition to automatically detect resources and collect them unlike some other bots that depend on a schedule, this bot can adapt to different base designs and newer buildings automatically.

## TODO:

Collect soldiers/millitary stuff from army buildings ingame, \
make scanning faster, \
add detection and correction for ingame glitches and announcments. \
